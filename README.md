# Lift-Me-Up
Single or Multiplayer-Coop 2,5D Platformer, the Players have to repair a space station while solving puzzles together. Created by Erik Thor Damisch, Thomas Sankowski, Dennis Franke. All rights reserved.

My Job was to Program everything Gameplay related except the Player movement. All of my assignments are shown in the presentation and in the picture.
Everything else like the Menu and Playermovement was done by my colleagues.
The Game is not quite finished and polished as I would like but we have some levels to test. First you should start a new game as single Player, when you reached the level select screen you move down twice to reach the tutorial. After playing the tutorial you can proceed with level 1, after finishing a level the next level will be unlocked. The multiplayer does not have a tutorial accessable but the controls are the same as singleplayer except that you control the jetpack of your friend. Have fun trying out our game and if you have any questions or anything to say feel free to contact me per e-mail:erikdamisch@live.com.
